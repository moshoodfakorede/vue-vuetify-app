The commission advised that the lead PFA (Stanbic) recognize the second payment on the current (Feb. 17) invoice to be submitted (as double payment) in order to net off the amount paid from the current fees before approval.

FINCON & FUND ACCOUNTS have been notified for necessary action.

Unlike ARM P, Stanbic PFA(lead PFA) did not honour the second approval received in Feb 2017, (which confirmed that Stanbic did not double pay) and as such could not reflect the fee (2nd) paid on February 17 invoice (as advised by the commission).

However, a formal notification of the double payment of the Fee by ARM P was presented to the commission on the 30th March, 2017 with a request that the 2nd payment made be recognized on and net off February 17 asset based fees approval.

The Commission has acknowledged the receipt of our instruction on the fees and it is expected that the second fee paid will be recognized and netted off February 17 fees payable. Will continue to follow up.

The fees accrued for February 17, is lower than Aug 16 fees erroneously paid twice, therefore the netting off will no longer reflect in February 17 but March 17 approval.
